    <h1>ABOUT SKY SURE DEAL</h1>


    <p>“Evolution and the theories of evolution are fundamentally different
        things,” testified zoologist Maynard M. Metcalf, the first expert witness
        for the defense in the 1925 Scopes trial. Metcalf’s observation at the
        “trial of the century” officially marked the beginning of public discussion of
        the different meanings of evolution for the purposes of science education.
        “The fact of evolution is a thing that is perfectly and absolutely clear,” Metcalf
        explained, “but there are many points—theoretical points as to the
        methods by which evolution has been brought about—that we are not yet
        in possession of scientific knowledge to answer.”1<br>
        Metcalf’s statement suggested, as many modern biologists have noted,
        that the term evolution can mean different things. His comment also suggested
        that not all senses of evolution have the same epistemological standing.
        We can assert confidently that evolution “has occurred,” Metcalf
        explained, but we may be more uncertain about how it occurred.<br>
        Metcalf made this distinction to show the court that critique of evolution
        in one sense did not necessarily count as critique of evolution in other
        senses. To assume otherwise would be to commit the logical fallacy of
        equivocation. He feared that confusion between the fact of evolution and
        the theory of evolution would justify excluding all teaching about evolution</p>


        <p>simply because some aspects of evolutionary theory did not have the same
            degree of confirmation as others.2<br>
            Of course, science teachers must also avoid equivocation, if only because
            they don’t want to confuse their students. Yet for biology teachers, this
            may prove difficult—given the many separate meanings that the term evolution
            has come to possess. As Yale biologist Keith Stewart Thomson has
            shown, the term evolution may have more than just two meanings.3<br>
            Equivocal usage poses a practical difficulty for science teachers. Good
            science teachers must define terms carefully and use them consistently to
            avoid conflating different ideas. Good biology teachers must tease apart the
            distinct ideas associated with evolution to help students to evaluate each
            idea separately and to distinguish evidence and observations, on the one
            hand, from inferences and theories, on the other.<br>
            Thomson identified at least three distinct meanings associated with evolution
            in contemporary biology: change over time, common ancestry, and
            the natural mechanisms that produce change in organisms.4 This essay will
            further refine these distinctions and present six distinct meanings. In so
            doing, we want to help science educators distinguish well-established from
            less well-established senses of the term evolution. We also want to help
            teachers avoid false controversies over senses of the term that enjoy wide
            scientific confirmation and support and to help them explain the real controversies
            that remain over more theoretically contentious propositions.<br>
            The following definitions develop and distinguish those multiple meanings,
            which we propose as guideposts for clear biology instruction.</p>
